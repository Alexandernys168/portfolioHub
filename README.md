This is a portfolio site built with Next.js.

## Adding projects

Projects live in the `projects` directory. To add a new project simply create a
folder inside `projects` and add a `project.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "My Project",
  "description": "Short description"
}
```

Optionally you can include a `README.md` or `index.js` file which will be shown
on the project page.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
